<!-- intro -->
A few more questions — these are more specific than the last batch, and some of them touch on things that can feel loaded, like grades and test scores. We're not using them to tell you what you can or can't get into. We're using them to show you schools where students with similar profiles tend to end up happy. There's a lot more overlap in that pool than most people realize.
