<!-- intro -->
Before we show you any actual schools to think about, we want to get a sense of you. None of this goes into a file anywhere, and there are genuinely no wrong answers. This is just us getting a sense of what you care about.

<!-- question id="current-school" type="checkbox" -->
How does your high school feel to you, most of the time? Check any that apply.

- Too big. I'd like to be part of a tight-knit community.
- Too small. I want to be in a place with lots of people and lots of options.
- Too social. I mostly care about my classes, and find the social scene dull. 
- Too much of a grind. Too many of my classmates are focused on GPA.
- Too narrow. I'd like to be around lots of kinds of people.

<!-- question id="setting" type="radio" -->
When you picture yourself somewhere new next fall, what's outside?

- A city — coffee shops, strangers, things happening off-campus
- A college town — everything revolves around the school
- Somewhere quiet — space, trees, actual weather
- Honestly I haven't given it much thought, or don't have a strong preference

<!-- question id="distance" type="radio" -->
How far from home are you thinking of going?

- Close — I want home to be easy to get to
- Far enough to feel independent, close enough to get back
- As far as possible, ideally
- I'm happy to go to a good school anywhere

<!-- question id="interests" type="textarea" -->
Outside your classes, is there something you're already into — a subject, a hobby, a thing you know a lot about — that you'd want to keep doing in college?

placeholder: could be anything — a sport, a craft, a weird obsession, a cause, a question you can't stop thinking about

<!-- question id="gut-feeling" type="checkbox" -->
Where are you on thinking about what schools you might want to apply to? (Remember, there are no wrong answers.)

- I am basically starting from scratch
- I have a few schools I'm interested in, but nothing definitive
- I have a few schools I definitely want to apply to, but need to consider other options
- I feel pretty good about my list of schools
- I have too many schools on my list, and need to to cut it down

<!-- outro -->
That's it for now. Next we'll ask a few more concrete things — academic interests, schools you've already heard of — and then we'll explain what we're actually going to show you and why.
