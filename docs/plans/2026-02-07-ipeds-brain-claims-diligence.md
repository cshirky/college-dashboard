# IPEDSBrain — Claims Risk Review & Diligence Report

**Date:** February 2026
**Purpose:** Verify every external and statistical claim in the proposal decks before presentation. Prevent credibility damage from incorrect or weakly supported claims.

**Verdict:** The executive deck contains **multiple incorrect IPEDS statistics** that must be corrected before any external presentation. External ecosystem claims are generally supported but require precision edits. See detailed findings below.

---

## 1. External Ecosystem Claims

### 1A. NCES Staffing Claim

**Claim in deck:** "NCES — the agency that maintains IPEDS — has been reduced to 3 staff members."

**Verification: PARTIALLY ACCURATE — needs nuance.**

- The Hechinger Report (March 2025) reported NCES was reduced from ~100 employees to "a skeletal staff of 3." Source: https://hechingerreport.org/proof-points-chaos-confusion-statistics-education/
- Inside Higher Ed (March 2025) confirmed "Layoffs Gut Federal Education Research Agency." Source: https://www.insidehighered.com/news/students/academics/2025/03/14/layoffs-gut-federal-education-research-agency
- AIR (Association for Institutional Research) issued a formal statement on NCES layoffs (March 2025). Source: https://www.airweb.org/article/2025/03/12/air-statement-on-nces-layoffs
- As of late 2025, NCES had been partially restored to approximately 11 staff members.
- Inside Higher Ed (September 2025) reported "Gutted NCES Releases First Batch of Higher Ed Data." Source: https://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-issues/research/2025/09/25/gutted-nces-releases-first-batch-higher-ed-data

**Recommendation:** Update claim to: "NCES was reduced from approximately 100 staff to as few as 3 in early 2025. Staffing has been partially restored but remains a fraction of historical levels." Cite Hechinger Report and Inside Higher Ed. Do NOT claim "3 staff" as the current state — it was the low point.

**Risk level:** LOW if corrected. The underlying point (NCES severely weakened, IPEDS tools at risk) is well-documented and widely reported.

### 1B. EDUCAUSE Top IT Issue

**Claim in deck:** "EDUCAUSE named 'The Data-Empowered Institution' the #1 IT issue for 2025."

**Verification: ACCURATE.**

- EDUCAUSE Review published "2025 EDUCAUSE Top 10 #1: The Data-Empowered Institution" in October 2024. Source: https://er.educause.edu/articles/2024/10/2025-educause-top-10-1-the--data-empowered--institution
- Full Top 10 list: https://www.educause.edu/research-and-publications/research/top-10-it-issues-technologies-and-trends/2025
- Campus Technology confirmed: "Data, AI Lead Educause Top 10 List for 2025." Source: https://campustechnology.com/articles/2024/11/04/data-ai-lead-educause-top-10-list-for-2025.aspx

**Recommendation:** Claim is accurate as stated. Optionally quote the subtitle: "Using data, analytics, and AI to increase student success, win the enrollment race, increase research funding, and reduce inefficiencies."

**Risk level:** NONE.

---

### 1C. Gartner Agentic AI Trend

**Claim in competitive landscape doc:** "Gartner named agentic AI the top tech trend of 2025" and "33% of enterprise software will include it by 2028."

**Verification: ACCURATE.**

- Gartner published "Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends for 2025" (October 2024), with Agentic AI listed first. Source: https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-10-21-gartner-identifies-the-top-10-strategic-technology-trends-for-2025
- The 33% figure is confirmed: "33% of enterprise software applications will include agentic AI by 2028, up from less than 1% in 2024."
- A more recent Gartner prediction (August 2025) says 40% of enterprise apps will feature task-specific AI agents by 2026. Source: https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-08-26-gartner-predicts-40-percent-of-enterprise-apps-will-feature-task-specific-ai-agents-by-2026-up-from-less-than-5-percent-in-2025

**Note:** Gartner also predicts over 40% of agentic AI projects will be canceled by end of 2027 (June 2025). This is worth knowing but not necessary to include.

**Recommendation:** Claim is accurate. Not currently in either presentation deck (only in competitive landscape doc).

**Risk level:** NONE.

---

### 1D. "85% of Institutions Increasing Digital Transformation Spending"

**Claim in competitive landscape doc:** "85% of institutions are increasing digital transformation spending."

**Verification: UNVERIFIABLE — cannot find exact source.**

- The most relevant source is the Higher Ed Innovation Index 2025 (Transact + CBORD), which reports "49% of campuses are accelerating tech investments." Source: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251105755707/en/
- EY research states "over 3/4 of institutions plan to increase spending on digital improvements in the next three years."
- The specific "85%" figure was not found in any authoritative publication.

**Recommendation:** REMOVE this claim. Replace with the EY figure ("over 75% plan to increase digital spending") if needed, or the CBORD/Transact "49% accelerating tech investments" figure. Neither is exactly 85%.

**Risk level:** MEDIUM if kept. The claim is directionally correct but the specific number is unsourced.

---

### 1E. University of Hawaii / EAB Pricing

**Claim in competitive landscape doc:** "University of Hawaii approved $7.4 million over 5 years for Navigate360 + Edify for 10 campuses (~$148K/campus/year)."

**Verification: ACCURATE.**

- Honolulu Star-Advertiser (June 2025): "University of Hawaii puts $7.4M into student success platform." Source: https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/06/23/hawaii-news/university-of-hawaii-puts-7-4m-into-student-success-platform/
- University of Hawaii official news (June 2025): "New technology platforms approved for systemwide student support." Source: https://www.hawaii.edu/news/2025/06/18/new-technology-systemwide-student-support/
- Confirmed: $7.4M, five-year subscription, Navigate360 + Edify, 10 UH campuses.

**Recommendation:** Claim is accurate. Good verifiable pricing data point.

**Risk level:** NONE.

---

### 1F. EAB "10 Days" Implementation

**Claim in competitive landscape doc:** "EAB can stand up core platform in as few as 10 days."

**Verification: SOURCED FROM EAB MARKETING.**

- This claim comes from EAB's own Edify FAQ page: https://eab.com/edify-faq/
- It refers specifically to the Edify data platform core setup, not the full analytics suite.

**Recommendation:** Attribute clearly: "EAB claims..." Not currently in either presentation deck.

**Risk level:** LOW. Vendor's own claim.

---

### 1G. HelioCampus "12-month Implementation"

**Claim in competitive landscape doc:** HelioCampus has a "12-month implementation timeline for foundational dashboards."

**Verification: SOURCED FROM HELIOCAMPUS DOCUMENTATION.**

- Referenced in HelioCampus platform documentation and E&I contract materials.

**Recommendation:** Attribute clearly if used in presentations. Not currently in either deck.

**Risk level:** LOW.

---

### 1H. New IPEDS Reporting Requirements 2025-2026

**Claim in deck:** "New IPEDS reporting requirements for 2025-2026 are expanding data collection."

**Verification: ACCURATE.**

- AGB (Association of Governing Boards): "Institutions Might Face Extensive New Mandate for 2025-2026 Data." Source: https://agb.org/blog-post/institutions-might-face-extensive-new-mandate-for-2025-2026-data-what-questions-should-boards-be-asking/
- Federal Register (August 2025): "Agency Information Collection Activities; Comment Request; Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) 2024-25 Through 2026-27." Source: https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/08/15/2025-15536/

**Recommendation:** Claim is accurate and well-sourced.

**Risk level:** NONE.

## 2. IPEDS Statistics in Executive Deck Examples

**These are the highest reputational risk items.** The executive deck uses University of Michigan and Big Ten data as illustrative examples. Every number was checked against our IPEDS 2023 dataset.

### 2A. University of Michigan Profile Example (Slide 5)

| Claim in Deck | Actual (IPEDS 2023) | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Admission rate: 18% | 18.0% | CORRECT |
| "down from 23% in 2019" | **Cannot verify — only 2023 data available** | UNVERIFIABLE |
| "Among the 50 most selective public institutions" | Rank 8 of 544 public institutions | CORRECT (rank 8 is well within top 50) |
| Yield rate: 47% | **Not in our dataset** (would need DVADM04) | UNVERIFIABLE |
| "ranking 3rd among Big Ten peers" (yield) | **Not in our dataset** | UNVERIFIABLE |
| 6-year graduation rate: 93% | **94.0%** | WRONG — off by 1 point |
| "up 2 points over 5 years" | **Cannot verify — only 2023 data** | UNVERIFIABLE |
| "Ranks 1st among Big Ten peers" (grad rate) | **Rank 2** — Northwestern is 95% | WRONG |
| "96th percentile nationally among public universities" | **99.3rd percentile** among publics | WRONG (understated) |
| Total enrollment: 48,090 | **52,065** | WRONG — off by ~4,000 |
| Undergraduate: 33,126 | **33,730** | WRONG — off by ~600 |
| 49% women | **52%** | WRONG — off by 3 points |
| 12% underrepresented minority | **19%** (Black + Hispanic + AIAN + NHPI + Two or More) | WRONG — off by 7 points |
| 16% international | **17%** | WRONG — off by 1 point |

**Summary: 4 correct, 4 unverifiable, 7 wrong.** Several errors are significant (enrollment off by 4,000, URM off by 7 points).

---

### 2B. Peer Benchmarking Example (Slide 6)

| Claim in Deck | Actual (IPEDS 2023) | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Michigan admission rate: 18% | 18.0% | CORRECT |
| Big Ten median admission rate: 57% | **52.5%** | WRONG — off by 4.5 points |
| Michigan admission percentile: 99th | Depends on definition — rank 2/14 within Big Ten | MISLEADING (Northwestern is more selective) |
| Michigan admission rank: 1 of 14 | **Rank 2** — Northwestern is 7% | WRONG |
| Michigan grad rate: (shown as part of table) | 94.0% | (was shown as 93% in profile slide) |
| Big Ten median grad rate: 74% | **84.5%** | WRONG — off by 10.5 points |
| Michigan Pell: 16% | **18.0%** | WRONG — off by 2 points |
| Big Ten median Pell: 24% | **18.5%** | WRONG — off by 5.5 points |
| Michigan Pell percentile: 22nd | **~50th** (Michigan is near the Big Ten median) | WRONG — narrative completely changes |
| % URM enrollment Michigan: 12% | **19.0%** | WRONG — off by 7 points |
| Big Ten median URM: 15% | **18.0%** | WRONG — off by 3 points |

**Summary: 1 correct, 10 wrong.** The Pell narrative is inverted — the deck claims Michigan lags significantly on Pell (16% vs 24% median), but in reality Michigan (18%) is near the Big Ten median (18.5%). The "Michigan lags on socioeconomic diversity" finding is not supported by the actual data.

---

### 2C. Equity Audit Example (Slide 7)

| Claim in Deck | Actual (IPEDS 2023) | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Graduation rates by race (White 95%, Asian 96%, Black 83%, Hispanic 89%, Pell 87%) | **Data does not exist in our dataset** | FABRICATED |

**This is the most serious issue.** The equity audit slide shows graduation rates broken down by race and Pell status. Our IPEDS dataset contains only:
- `grad_rate_6yr` — the overall institutional graduation rate
- `pct_black`, `pct_hispanic`, etc. — **enrollment** demographics, not graduation rates by subgroup

Graduation rates by race require the GRS (Graduation Rate Survey) subgroup tables, which we did not download or process. The numbers in the equity slide were invented, not computed.

**Risk level:** CRITICAL. Presenting fabricated graduation-rate-by-race data to a university audience would be devastating to credibility.

---

### 2D. Trend Analysis Example (Slide 8)

| Claim in Deck | Actual (IPEDS 2023) | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Michigan admission rate change (-5 pts) | **Cannot verify — only 2023 data** | UNVERIFIABLE |
| Northwestern admission rate change (-7 pts) | Cannot verify | UNVERIFIABLE |
| Rutgers (+1 pt), Indiana (+2 pts) | Cannot verify | UNVERIFIABLE |
| Big Ten median dropped from 63% to 57% | Cannot verify | UNVERIFIABLE |
| "Spread widened from 48 to 54 points" | Cannot verify | UNVERIFIABLE |

**All trend claims are unverifiable** because we only have a single year of IPEDS data (2023). Multi-year data (2019-2023) would be needed.

**Risk level:** HIGH if presented as factual. These should be explicitly marked as illustrative/hypothetical, or computed from actual multi-year data before presentation.

---

## 3. Methodology Transparency Gaps

An IPEDS expert reviewing the executive deck would immediately ask:

### Peer-group construction rules
- **Current state:** The deck uses "Big Ten" as a peer group but does not specify which members or which year's conference membership. The Big Ten expanded from 14 to 18 members in August 2024. Our IPEDS 2023 data predates the expansion.
- **Recommendation:** Explicitly state "Big Ten as of 2022-23 academic year (14 members)" and list all members.

### URM definition
- **Current state:** The deck claims "12% URM" but does not define which groups are included.
- **Actual computation:** Black + Hispanic + AIAN + NHPI + Two or More = 19%. If we exclude Two or More (some definitions do), it's 14%. The "12%" in the deck matches neither definition.
- **Recommendation:** Define URM explicitly. The most common IPEDS definition includes Black, Hispanic, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander. Document whether "Two or More Races" is included.

### Year alignment
- **Current state:** Not specified in examples.
- **Recommendation:** All data should be labeled as "IPEDS 2023 (Fall 2023 collection)" to avoid confusion with academic year (2022-23) or fiscal year.

### Missing/suppressed data handling
- **Current state:** Not addressed.
- **Recommendation:** Document that institutions with 0% admission rate or 0% graduation rate are excluded as data artifacts (73 institutions filtered). Document how NaN values are handled in median calculations (pandas default: exclude).

### Percentile methodology
- **Current state:** The deck claims percentiles without specifying the population.
- **Recommendation:** Specify: "Percentile among [N] public 4-year bachelor's-granting institutions with non-null admission/graduation rates in IPEDS 2023."

## 4. Minimum Evidence Package Before Public Claims

### Status of required items:

| Requirement | Status |
|---|---|
| Reproducible datasets for every statistic shown | NOT MET — examples use fabricated numbers |
| Variable-level IPEDS citations for each metric | PARTIALLY MET — citations shown are illustrative, not computed |
| Peer-set definition artifacts | NOT MET — Big Ten membership not documented |
| Written methodology explaining all calculations | NOT MET |
| Independent verification reproducing identical numbers | NOT MET — numbers don't match actual data |

### Remediation plan:

1. **Replace all example statistics** in both decks with numbers computed directly from the IPEDS 2023 dataset. Use the verified numbers from this diligence report.
2. **Remove or clearly label unverifiable claims.** Trend data (multi-year), yield rates, and graduation rates by race cannot be computed from current data. Either:
   - Download additional IPEDS tables (GRS subgroup tables, multi-year DRVADM/DRVGR) and compute real numbers, OR
   - Explicitly label these examples as "illustrative — actual analysis would use [data source]"
3. **Remove the equity audit example entirely** until graduation-rate-by-race data is available. This is the highest-risk item.
4. **Document peer group membership** explicitly (list all 14 Big Ten schools used).
5. **Define URM** and specify which racial/ethnic categories are included.
6. **Update NCES staffing claim** to reflect the trajectory (reduced to 3, partially restored to ~11) rather than stating "3" as current.
7. **Remove "85% digital transformation spending" claim** — no authoritative source found.
